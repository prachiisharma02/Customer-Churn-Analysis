# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project analyzes a telecom company's customer churn data to uncover trends and patterns using Python libraries.

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers who stop using a company's services.

Identifying factors affecting churn helps companies improve customer retention strategies and reduce revenue loss.

# Objectives
1) Analyze customer behavior and identify churn patterns.
2) Visualize insights to understand relationships between features and churn.
3) Provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn rates.

# Technologies Used

**Programming Language**: Python
**Libraries**:
   1) **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
   2) **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
   3) **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
   4) **Seaborn**: Enhanced visualizations.

# Dataset Overview

**Source**: Mention if itâ€™s publicly available or simulated data.
**Description**:
1) Rows represent customers, and columns represent customer features such as:
2) CustomerID: Unique identifier.
3) Gender, Age: Demographic details.
4) Tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Service usage and billing information.
5) Churn: Target variable indicating if the customer has churned (Yes/No).


# Key Features
1) Tenure: Duration of service subscription.
2) Monthly Charges: Monthly expenditure of customers.
3) Contract Type: Type of subscription contract.
4) Churn: Indicator of customer churn.

# Steps in the Analysis

1) **Data Import and Cleaning**
2) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3)**Key Insights**:
      Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
      Month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates than long-term contracts.

# Key Findings
1) Short-tenured customers are more likely to churn.
2) Monthly charges significantly impact churn probability.
3) Long-term contracts reduce churn rates.

# Recommendations
1) Offer discounts to encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts.
2) Introduce loyalty programs for high-risk customers (e.g., short tenure or high monthly charges).
3) Provide targeted offers to reduce churn among specific customer segments.

# Conclusion
**Summarize**:
  The most important factors influencing churn.
  Recommendations for reducing churn.
